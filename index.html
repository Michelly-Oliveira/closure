		<h1>Closure</h1>
		<h3>
			Closure is when an inner function has access to the outer(enclosing)
			function's variables
		</h3>
		<p>
			Closure is when an inner function is able to access outside scope, scope
			from the outer function.
		</p>
		<p>
			A way to remember and continue to access a function's scope even once the
			function has finished executing(the data cease to exist when the function
			ends).
		</p>
		<p>
			An inner function maintains a scope reference to where it was originally
			declared(at author time)
		</p>
		<p>
			In JS, closures are created every time a function is created, at function
			creation time. You can check the closure feature using the
			debugger(breakpoint)
		</p>
		<p>
			A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment
			within which that function was declared. This environment consist of any
			local variables that were in-scope at the time the closure was created.
		</p>
		<p>
			Closures let you associate data(lexical environment) with a function that
			operates on that data. You can use closure anywhere that you might
			normally use an object with only a single method
